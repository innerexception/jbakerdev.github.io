Phase 5 Goal: 
	-Phase 4 + Victory condition flow
		-Whenever you die, show collected/remaining consumables.
		-Boring way: Get the brass ring, do not get the tome, the demon avoids you.
			-Game continues...sanity still degrades. Eventually you run out of consumables and die.
		-Method 2: Collect all the consumables. You glow, then when touching the demon you destroy it and become a demon.
		-Method 3: Find the tome. Do not pick up the brass ring. The demon will chase you regardless of distance
			You are now equipped with flaming projectiles equal to the number of consumables collected.
			Fire your flaming consumables at the demon to kill it, if you have enough and if you hit it. 
			This causes time to stop and you appear in the normal world.
